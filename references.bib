  abstract  = "Classification procedures are some of the most widely used
               statistical methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and
               powerful statistical classifier that is well established in
               other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology.
               Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers
               include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel
               method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model
               complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility
               to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including
               regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised
               learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We
               compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used
               statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species
               presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare
               lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest
               sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah,
               USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all
               applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of
               the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to
               other common classification methods. We also observed that the
               variables that RF identified as most important for classifying
               invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the
               literature.",

  abstract  = "Many systems have been developed for constructing decision trees

               often suffer the disadvantage of excessive complexity and are

               discusses techniques for simplifying decision trees while
               retaining their accuracy. Four methods are described,
               illustrated, and compared on a test-bed of decision trees from a
               variety of domains.",

               for classifying economic activity within the European Union,
               building on the relevance of a reduced set of variables
               alongside location and industry of origin for the differences in
               performance between foreign versus locally-owned companies. We
               find a diverse landscape of business performance within the
               European Union that does not indicate a clear-cut dominance of
               foreign-owned companies against their locally-owned peers.
               Locally-owned companies from the Eastern European Union have
               been more dynamic than their foreign-owned peers in the region,
               which suggests a process of learning from foreign competitors
               and business partners. The Random Forests model performs
               surprisingly well given the low number of predictors and
               indicates that personnel costs per employee is the most
               important variable that discriminates between foreign and
               locally-owned companies. The importance of the rest of the
